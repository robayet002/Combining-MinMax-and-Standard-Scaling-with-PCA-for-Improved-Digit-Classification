Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step in many machine learning algorithms to ensure that all features contribute equally to the result. This project explores MinMax scaling and Standard scaling techniques. Additionally, it includes the detection and removal of outliers using the 3 Standard Deviation method to improve data quality. Finally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for digit recognition.

MinMax Scaling
MinMax scaling transforms features by scaling each feature to a given range, usually between 0 and 1.

Standard Scaling
Standard scaling transforms features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

Outlier Detection and Removal
Outliers are detected and removed using the 3 Standard Deviation method.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is used for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.

The results include scaled datasets, filtered datasets without outliers, and transformed datasets using PCA. These results can be used for further machine learning tasks such as digit recognition.
